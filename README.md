### Debugger Issues From IntelliJ Tests

In the app each button will run a test from the IntelliJ debugger test suite. The test is isolated in a file directly coppied from the IntelliJ tet data 
directory, for example [funLiteral.kt](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/master/plugins/kotlin/jvm-debugger/test/testData/stepping/custom/funLiteral.kt)

The test file is also runnable directly under a JVM. This is useful for comparing JVM to Android under debugging.

The test file contains instructions and hilights the issue.
